# Hashmap repeated word

The challenge is to create a function called repeatedWord that find the first repeated word in a string. For example in the following string, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...", the first repeated word is 'It'.

## Implementation

The implementation of this function uses a hashtable to store words. The first word that matches one already stored in the hashtable is the first repeated word. For more about hashtables see the [hashtable implementation](../hashtable/README.md).
